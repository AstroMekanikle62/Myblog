        <p>Hi there! I am an electrical engineer who graduated in 2017 from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. Although I had the intentions of choosing mathematics or physics as my major,
          my first year at the university opened my eyes about how a single horrible teacher may ruin the future of many youngsters. Knowing how awful of a teacher I am and the fact that I will,
          if I get lucky, be stuck in a research lab, I chose the next best thing to mathematics which is electrical engineering. Recently,
          I discovered programming while messing around during my long free time after graduation and fell in love with it,
          I even developed a simple game called Fortuna using one of the most permitive game developing libraries known as "pygame" while all my knowledge came from a 10 hours video on youtube.
          In my free time I play video games, read novels, listen to music, and as you might guess, programming.</p>
